To create an accont go to "register" use a fake email adress ending with "@stud.noroff.no" and a minimum 8 characters password, write a bio and add a photo. And then click the button which will send you to the login page and use the same email and password to get in

Or use my fake account thing "BKA@stud.noroff.no" and password "Deadpool-2002". 

BTW Ive done the assignemnt on my very old latop since the macbook im currently using for all the assignments was in service due some issues with the laptop during the CA week, and the laptop i used was old as death itself so it didnt allow me to download VS Code or github so i needed to use Codepen and pray to god that i will get my macbook before the deadline of the CA so that i can properly deliver the assignemnt
